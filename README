mysql2sqlite3dump
#################

Script to convert a MySQL database dump to a sqlite3 friendly format. It is
written in python using `PyParsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com>`_.

There are many other scripts in many languages out there for this task (not-exhaustive list), like

* `Perl <http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=150476>`_
* `Shell Script <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/489277/script-to-convert-mysql-dump-sql-file-into-format-that-can-be-imported-into-sqli>`_
* `AWK <https://gist.github.com/esperlu/943776/>`_,

but none worked for me, so I wrote another one.

It is the result of a one-time conversion effort, and I have no clue about SQL, so it is probably not very robust. The parser only parses the subset of SQL that my conversion happened to require. But I hope that the code is a bit clearer and easier to read and understand, than a few of the other scripts. It even contains a few tests.
